		The InspectorPanel in LoadUI is the panel at the bottom of the screen which acts as a container 
		for various other panels (Inspectors).
	</p>
		
	<p>
		New Inspectors should be published as OSGi Services and will automatically be picked up by 
		loadUI and displayed in the InspectorPanel. Customizing where the Inspector should be visible 
		is done by setting the OSGi Service Property "loadui.inspector.visibility" (defaults to always 
		visible). The format for this is a semi-colon (;) separated list of context names, using an 
		asterisk (*) as a wildcard.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		For example, setting the value to "workspace;project" causes the Inspector to only be visible 
		when in the workspace context and the project context.
