		The Statistics Package is the core that allows loadUI to show statistics in the StatisticsWindow. The package revolves around the following classes:
		<ul>
			<h4>{@link StatisticVariable}</h4>
			<h4>Statistic</h4>
			<h4>Datapoint</h4>
			A datapoint represents a single 2D data point, having a timestamp and a Number value.
			<h4>StatisticsWriter</h4>
			Writes statistics data to a Track (which eventually ends up in  the H2 database). A StatisticsWriter can expose several Statistics.
			<h4>StatisticHolder</h4>'
			A Holder of Statistics (typically a loadUI Component or Testcase ). Fires CollectionEvents for contained StatisticVariables.
			<h4>StatisticManager</h4>
			A registry of available Statistics and StatisticHolders, and the settings they use. Fires a CollectionEvent when StatisticHolders are added or removed.
		</ul>
